## stellaris-mod-large-galaxy

- Adds "extreme", 2000-size, galaxy generation setting with severely decreased amount of habitable planets.
- The base amount of habitable planets for the "extreme" is 20%, meaning if you select 0.25x habitable planets game generation setting, the resulting amount of habitable planets compared to unmodded 1x will be 5%.
- Does not change the default crisis strength, amount of wormholes or gateways.
- Decreases core size for 4-spiral galaxy.
